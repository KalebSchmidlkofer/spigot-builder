# Spigotmc-Builder

## Requirements

To use this program, you must have the following installed

- python 3.10 or greater
- Docker

## What it's for

This app is for another one that I'm making called
[mc-jars](https://github.com/KalebSchmidlkofer/mc-jars)
It was made because my favorite jar provider [serverjars](https://serverjars.com/)
kinda stopped working properly.
